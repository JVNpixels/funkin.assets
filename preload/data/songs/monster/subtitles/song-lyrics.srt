1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,420
Guess it's time,

2
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,760
you better plug in all your nightlights.

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,000
What's out there, past your darkened door?

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,480
Just the eyes floating up out of the shore.

5
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,080
Hey man, I'm gonna eat your girlfriend,

6
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,620
Or maybe turn her into broth,

7
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,760
la-la-la la la

8
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,340
Kill a kid, cut em up.

9
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,800
stuff em up inside of my, secret meat box.

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,820
Find my, hands across your body slowly

11
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,180
peel your skin off.

12
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,160
You'll meet your friends,

13
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,780
inside the ambulance.

14
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,220
Call into the night,

15
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,460
to the werewolf.

16
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,260
Give all your blood to him,

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,540
stand under the warm street light.

18
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,420
Let yourself be hypnotized.

19
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,100
You're just a little snack,

20
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,840
and so is your girlfriend.

21
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,840
Hey man, I'm gonna tear your eyes out,

22
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,600
and then I'll boil your girlfriend,

23
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,660
la-la-la la la

24
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,560
Kill a kid, cut em up.

25
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,520
stuff em up inside of my, burning dungeon.

26
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,600
I would give you guys a little break but

27
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,700
I'm not Satan.
