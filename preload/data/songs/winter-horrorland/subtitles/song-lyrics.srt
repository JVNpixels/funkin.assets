1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,900
Your skin is freezing,

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,800
here let me help you take it off.

3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,060
Feasting with your friends,

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,500
what a perfect way to end,

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,180
all these lonely holidays.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,620
La-la-la-la.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,300
You take a piece of your rabies,

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,440
and vivisect your mind.

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,600
Snowman smiling with your teeth,

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,900
fallen angels created with your meat.

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,080
That pearly smile.

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,760
Cut, in a thousand slices.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,460
Bake you 'til, golden brown.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,180
Stuff you with spices.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,740
Serve to friends around.

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,080
Separate you from your eyes,

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,240
turn your girlfriend inside out,

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,420
burn her fingernails.

19
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,820
La-la-la-la.

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,220
Soak your hands in freezing water.

21
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,260
Watching as the skin gets softer.

22
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,480
See your bones appear in dark red snow...

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,560
drop further below.

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,460
You take a piece of your rabies,

25
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,920
and vivisect your mind.

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,560
And take a peek inside your head,

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,880
and find the worm inside.

28
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,140
Cut, in a thousand slices.

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,800
Bake you 'til, golden brown.

30
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,720
Fill you with spices.

31
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,040
Serve to friends around.

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,940
Turn the heat on high and we'll reduce your blood...

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,280
...boil 'lil boyfriend...

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,020
...with brandy and plums.
